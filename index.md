<p>
	I'm a grade 11 student at Hugh McRoberts Secondary School. I'm most passionate about math contests and olympiads but I also enjoy learning chemistry and physics.
</p>
<h2> Hobbies </h2>
<ul>
	<li> I love to solve challenging math questions, particularly math olympiad problems. </li>
	<li> I like doing programming contests on <a href="https://dmoj.ca/">DMOJ</a>. </li>
	<li> I enjoy going to hackathons. </li>
</ul>
<h2> Interests </h2>
<ul>
	<li> Anything math-related. </li>
	<li> I like problem-solving in general. </li>
	<li> Machine learning, AI, and neural networks are cool. </li>
	<li> I like thinking about various philosophy and psychology topics, and reading the rationality sequences on <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/">lesswrong.com</a>. </li>
</ul>
<h2> Fun Facts About Myself </h2>
<ul>
	<li> My favorite math olympiad subject is geometry. </li>
	<li> My favorite color is green. </li>
	<li> I tend to have a lot of tabs open on my browser (sometimes over 50 at the same time).</li>
</ul>
<h2> Impossible List </h2>
<p>
	I love to challenge myself! I created this list of "impossible" challenges, to see which ones I can achieve. I got the idea from <a href="https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/">here</a>.
</p>
<table id="impossiblelist">
  <tr>
    <th style="width: 40%">Challenge</th>
    <th style="width: 10%">Status</th>
    <th style="width: 20%">Tags</th>

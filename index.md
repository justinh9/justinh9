<h2> Impossible List </h2>
<p>
	I love to challenge myself! I created this list of "impossible" challenges, to see which ones I can achieve. I got the idea from <a href="https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/">here</a>.
</p>
<table id="impossiblelist">
  <tr>
    <th style="width: 40%">Challenge</th>
    <th style="width: 10%">Status</th>

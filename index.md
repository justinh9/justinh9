<p>
	I'm a grade 11 student at Hugh McRoberts Secondary School and also a concurrent student studying mathematics at the University of British Columbia. I'm most passionate about math contests/olympiads but I also enjoy learning chemistry, physics and a myriad of other subjects. 
</p>
<h2> Hobbies </h2>

	<li> I take pleasure in debating and attending Model United Nations conferences </li>
</ul>
<h2> Interests </h2>
<ul>
	<li> Anything math-related. For example, outside of contests, I am eager to learn about analysis and algebra. </li>
	<li> Application of mathematics in other fields such as statistics and risk management. </li>
	
</ul>
<h2> Fun Facts About Myself </h2>
<ul>
	<li> My favorite math olympiad subject is geometry. </li>
	<li> My favorite color is blue. </li>
	<li> I play volleyball, basketball and tennis</li>
	<li> I tend to have a lot of tabs open on my browser (88 at the moment).</li>
</ul>
<h2> Impossible List </h2>
<p>
	I love to challenge myself! I created this list of "impossible" challenges, to see which ones I can achieve. I got the idea from <a href="https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/">here</a>.

<table id="impossiblelist">
